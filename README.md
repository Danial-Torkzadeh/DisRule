StatRule: A visual tool for gaining intuition on probability distributions
hello anyone who is reading this . 
these files are for a concept called statrule . a tool for visualising statistical disstributions. 
for using them you can use the privided svg files, and if you want a new ruler with other degree of freedom you can use the code.
open the code and change the df parameter as you want, save it and run it, it will generate your statrule in svg format.
for disclosure haerby i announce i used ai for debugging and making the code a little more readable 
if you have any tought please share it with me through email at dtmahani@gmail.com

for 300 yaers slide rules where used for all kinds of calculation, and in 1980's they replaced with electrical calculators. 
my pupose for statrule was never a calculation tool, my goal was to make a tool that help children gain a better intuition af these probabilty distributions like t student, chi-squere, normal, and etc

i am corrently working on paper for explaining and introducing these rulers . 
hope you find these useful
